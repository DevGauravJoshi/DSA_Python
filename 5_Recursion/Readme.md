# Why Recursion?

• It helps us solving bigger/complex problems in simple way.

• Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.

• Helps breaking bigger problem to smaller problems.


Space complexity is the height of tree cause the stack is gonna be at max of the height the stack will not stack exceed the height of tree.
So, Space Complexity - O (n)
